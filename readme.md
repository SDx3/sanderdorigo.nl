# sanderdorigo.nl

This is the repository where my personal website (at [sanderdorigo.nl](https://www.sanderdorigo.nl/)) resides.

All blog posts (in `content/blog`) are from my own hand. You will also find drafts and things there, which you're free to read.

The entries in `content/stream` are a collection of various links and things, created and curated by yours truly. Browse through them, or visit the [dedicated page](https://www.sanderdorigo.nl/stream).

## Credits

The site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Researcher](https://github.com/ojroques/hugo-researcher) theme. It's hosted using an Azure static website bucket thing. A GitHub action (see `.github/workflows/b.yml`) builds the website. Because the "stream"-page updates nightly, this also allows me to schedule new blogs. You can always read them here in the repository ahead of time.

## Questions or comments
