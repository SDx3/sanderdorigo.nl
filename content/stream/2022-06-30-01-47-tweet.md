<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="nl" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re now up to a solid half year of delay in post-quantum standardization, apparently because NIST picked a new design in the middle of a patent minefield and was somehow confident it could instantly buy its way out of the minefield. Half a year of data given away to attackers.</p>&mdash; Daniel J.
